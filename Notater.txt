Grinding it out

Quote: I HAVE ALWAYS believed that each man makes his own happiness and is responsible for his own problems.

Quote: It follows, obviously, that a man must take advantage of any oppertunity that comes along.

Quote: Work is the meat in the hamburger of life.

Influence people with a simle and enthusiasm

Influence is fine as long as it maintains some contact with reality

Influence people, talk a straight forward approach. Do not beat around the bush to get there. Recognize the critical moment when you need to stop talking (hint: costumer glancing at his watch, looking out of the window, etc)

Help your costumer by improving their sales with your product!
